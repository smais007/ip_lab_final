## 🧠 Mission Statement

This repo exists solely for **academic survival** during the **Introduction to Programming Lab Exam**.  
It is **not** a place of learning. It is a place of **copy-pasting** and **panicking gracefully**.

## 🤝 For My Beloved Friends:

If you're here, it's because:

- You forgot what a `for` loop is.
- You think "segmentation fault" is a Marvel villain.
- You just want to pass and go home.

**Don't worry. I got you. Just do the following:**

1. Open the file.
2. Copy the code.
3. Paste it into your IDE.
4. Pretend you wrote it.
5. Submit and smile.

## 📜 Rules of the Brotherhood

1. If you get full marks, say you studied.
2. If you get caught, I don’t know you.
3. If the code doesn’t work, blame the compiler.
4. If we all fail, at least we fail together.
